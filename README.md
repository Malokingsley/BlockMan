You are about to be emerged in a world of blocks. Play as Block Man and hurdle your way over incoming blocks and with every jump your journey will become more difficult but your jump strength will increase making you jump higher. How ever be warned, the blocks being fired have the ability to cling to and become part of our hero making him heavier and making him lose some jump ability with each block added. Join the perilous journey and get our hero to the end of the game without losing all your lives.
